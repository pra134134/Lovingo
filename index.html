      <p class="description">
  Aarav was a web developer student. He loved learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of his days were spent building small websites, but deep inside, he sometimes felt lonely.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  One day in the library, he met Meera, a girl struggling with her computer project. Aarav decided to help, and that moment changed everything.
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  They started studying together. When the code failed, they laughed. When it finally worked, they celebrated like it was a big victory. Slowly, their friendship grew into something more beautiful.
</p>

<p class="description">
  One evening, after finishing a project, Aarav said softly, 
  “Meera, you are the best part of my life. Will you be with me always?”
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  Meera smiled and replied, “Yes, Aarav. Just like our code, we will fix errors and stay together forever.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  From that day on, Aarav knew the best creation of his life was not a website—it was his love story with Meera.

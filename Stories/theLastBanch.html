      <p>
  Once upon a time, in a city where monsoon painted everything in shades of grey and green, two hearts found each other not through grand gestures, but through quiet glances and shared silences. Their story began from the last bench of a classroom in Bhilai.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Aarav Malhotra stood at the entrance of his new college classroom, clutching his backpack, unsure where to sit. He chose the last bench—not out of shyness, but because it gave him the perfect view of everything. He liked observing. It was his way of understanding the world without disturbing it.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  That’s when Meera Kapoor walked in—simple braid, soft eyes, and a silence that spoke louder than words.
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  She wasn’t flashy or loud. Her kurti was plain, her steps graceful, and her presence calming. She settled two benches ahead of Aarav, placing her books with quiet care. She didn’t speak to anyone. She didn’t need to. Her silence was eloquent.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Days turned into weeks. Aarav never spoke to her, but he noticed everything—the way she smiled at the librarian, the sketchbook she always carried, the way she hummed when she thought no one was listening.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  In his notebook, he wrote: “Girl with the braid.” “Sketches in silence.” “Eyes like monsoon clouds.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  One rainy afternoon, the professor didn’t show up. Students rushed out, but Meera stayed, flipping through her sketchbook. Aarav hesitated, then walked up to her.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  “You like sitting alone?” he asked.  
  “Not alone. Just... peacefully,” she replied.
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  That one sentence turned into hours of conversation. They spoke about Bhilai’s old streets, her love for sketching, his obsession with Gulzar’s poetry. Meera had lost her father two years ago. She found comfort in drawing things she couldn’t say. Aarav understood—he wrote poetry to escape his mother’s illness.
</p>

<p class="description">
  From that day on, the last bench wasn’t just Aarav’s spot. It became their sanctuary.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  One evening, Meera handed him a sketch of their classroom. Two figures on the last bench. “I drew this for you,” she said. “Because this is where I found my peace.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  Aarav’s voice trembled. “Meera, I—”  
  She placed a finger on his lips. “I know.”
</p>

<p class="description">
  No declarations. No roses. Just quiet understanding. Shared silences. And the comfort of knowing someone sees you—even from the last bench.
</p>

<p class="description">
  In their final year, Meera got selected for a design program in Ahmedabad. Aarav was proud, but the thought of her leaving gnawed at him. They sat on the college terrace the night before her departure, watching stars.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  “Will you forget me?” he asked.  
  She laughed. “You’re the last bench boy. How could I?”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  He gave her a notebook of poems. She gave him her sketchbook—her heart, drawn in lines and shadows.
</p>

<p class="description">
  They promised to stay in touch. And they did. But distance stretches emotions thin. Conversations shortened. Replies delayed. Silence grew louder.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  One day, Aarav received a message: “I need time. I’m trying to figure things out.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  He didn’t reply. He respected her space, but it broke him. The last bench felt empty again.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Months passed. Aarav graduated, got a job in Raipur, tried to move on. But every sketch, every Gulzar poem, every walk past their college reminded him of her.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  Then, one winter morning, he received a parcel. Meera’s sketchbook. Inside was a new drawing—of a wedding mandap. Two figures, side by side. And a note: “I’m coming home. If you still see me from the last bench, I’ll be there.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  Aarav didn’t wait. He rushed to Bhilai, to the college, to the classroom. It was empty, dusty, forgotten. But he sat on the last bench, heart pounding.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  And then she walked in. Same braid. Same eyes. Same silence.
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  He stood up, walked to her, and whispered, “I still see you. Just like that first day.”
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  She smiled, like she always did—peacefully.

      <p class="description"> The train screeched to a halt at Bhadrapur, a small town in Uttar Pradesh where the
        station clock ticked slower than reality. Arjun stepped down, dragging his rucksack, muttering at the sight of
        the mossy walls and flickering lamps. </p>
       “God, this place looks straight out of a horror movie.” </blockquote>
      <p class="description"> The air smelled of damp earth and rusted iron—like ghost stories brought to life. Checking
        his phone, Arjun found no signal. Typical. </p>
      <p class="description"> That’s when he noticed her. A girl in a white kurta and jeans, dupatta slipping, hair
        playing with the wind. She sat under a dim lamp, reading <i>Devdas</i>. </p>
      <blockquote class="highlight-quote"> “You know Devdas didn’t need to drink himself to death, right? Paro wasn’t
        worth it.” </blockquote>
      She looked up, startled, eyes sharp. </p>
       “And you think Chandramukhi deserved better?” 
       Arjun chuckled. </p>
       “Definitely. At least she was loyal.”
      <p> Her lips curved in a half-smile. </p>
       “You talk like a corporate guy who thinks relationships are transactions.”
      </blockquote>
       “Caught red-handed, ma’am. MBA has killed all my romance. But I still believe
        in happy endings.” </blockquote>
      <p> She shut her book and tilted her head. </p>
      “Funny. Because this town doesn’t.” </blockquote>
      <p> Her words lingered in the air like a secret. Later, they shared an auto to the bazaar. The
        driver, with sunken eyes and a paan-stained beard, kept glancing at them in the mirror. </p>
       “Don’t go near the haveli after dark. The banyan tree doesn’t forgive.”
     
       Arjun frowned. </p>
       “What haveli?” 
      <p class="description"> The girl—Meera—didn’t answer. Silence pressed heavier than words. </p>
       “I’m Meera. I teach at the government school here.” 
       “Arjun. Consultant, stuck here against my will.” 
       She smiled faintly, as though she already knew him. That night, from his guesthouse
        window, Arjun saw the silhouette of a giant banyan tree—roots like monstrous veins. Behind it, a crumbling
        haveli stared back with hollow eyes. Fear whispered through him. </p>
      <p class="description"> And yet, stronger than the fear was the thought of Meera—her half-smile, her silence about
        the haveli. Where love begins, shadows gather too. </p>
    </article>

    <h1>Part-2 The Love </h1>

    <article class="story-content">
      <p class="description"> The next morning, Arjun walked toward the government school where Meera taught. The
        building was weathered, paint peeling like old memories. Children’s laughter spilled from the classrooms,
        cutting through the sleepy air of Bhadrapur. </p>
      <p class="description"> Meera stood at the blackboard, chalk in hand, hair tied into a careless bun. She was
        explaining fractions, her voice patient, eyes alive. Arjun leaned against the doorway, pretending to observe the
        project work pinned on the wall, but really just watching her. </p>
      “You’re late,” she said later, catching him outside. 
       “For what?” he teased. 
       “For the universe’s plan.” 
       They laughed. Slowly, Arjun began spending his evenings with her—helping at the school,
        walking through bazaars glowing with oil lamps, sipping kulhad chai under the banyan-lined lanes. </p>
      <p class="description"> In her presence, Bhadrapur seemed less suffocating. It breathed. </p>
      “You don’t belong here,” she told him one evening. 
      “And yet, I’ve never felt more at home.” 
      <p class="description"> Their bond deepened in stolen moments—her laughter over his clumsy Hindi, his fascination
        with her quiet resilience. She spoke of her students, of dreams bigger than the town’s dusty lanes. He shared
        stories of city life, of neon skylines and sleepless ambition. </p>
      <p class="description"> But even in laughter, there were shadows. Sometimes, when their walks took them near the
        banyan tree, Meera’s face would pale. She would grip his hand tighter and change the path. </p>
      “Why are you afraid of that haveli?” he asked once. 
      “Some places remember too much. Some wounds never heal,” she whispered.
      
      <p class="description"> Her words carried the weight of sorrow he couldn’t decode. And yet, love has its own
        stubbornness. Arjun didn’t press further. He believed his presence was enough to protect her. </p>
      <p class="description"> On Diwali night, the town lit up in sparklers and clay lamps. Arjun found Meera waiting
        under the banyan’s shadow, a lamp in her hand. The air hummed with both festivity and dread. </p>
       “Why here?” he asked, heart pounding. 
       “Because love isn’t real unless it stands against fear,” she said.
      </blockquote>
      <p class="description"> She placed the lamp at the foot of the tree. For a moment, the haveli’s broken windows
        glowed like fiery eyes, watching them. Arjun held her hand, and in that fragile light, they kissed. </p>
      <p class="description"> It wasn’t just a kiss. It was a pact, a defiance, a promise that their love would survive
        whatever haunted the roots of Bhadrapur. </p>




      <!-- part 3 -->

      <h1>Part 3: The Haunting </h1>

      <article class="story-content">x
        <p class="description"> The kiss had been real, but so was the fear it invited. From that Diwali night onward,
          the haveli did not remain just a shadow in the background—it began seeping into their lives, quiet and
          deliberate. </p>
        <p class="description"> It started with small disturbances. Arjun woke one night to a scratching sound at his
          door. When he opened it, the corridor was empty. Yet, scattered across the floor were wilted marigolds—the
          same flowers villagers left at the banyan’s roots. He laughed nervously, convincing himself it was a prank,
          but the chill in his bones refused to fade. </p>
        <p class="description"> The next day, he noticed Meera’s unease. Her laughter felt practiced, her smile brittle.
          He caught sight of her wrist—faint bruises shaped like fingers, as though someone had gripped her too tightly.
        </p>
        <p class="description"> When he asked, her answer was quiet and strange. “Not someone,” she said, eyes lowered.
          “Something.” </p>
        <p class="description"> That evening, he followed her. She walked with a bundle of rice, incense, and flowers
          toward the banyan tree. The path was deserted, shadows stretched long. Arjun’s chest tightened with each step
          closer to the looming roots. </p>
        <p class="description"> Meera placed the offerings at the base of the tree with trembling hands. The wind
          stirred violently, rattling the dry leaves. For a fleeting second, Arjun thought the roots moved—curling like
          the fingers of some ancient hand. From the haveli behind, a window slammed shut though no one lived there.
        </p>
        <p class="description"> That night, Arjun dreamt of the haveli. Endless corridors, footsteps echoing, walls
          breathing dampness. A woman stood beneath the banyan, dressed as a bride, her veil torn and dripping with
          blood. She whispered his name, stretching it like a prayer and a curse—“Arjun…” </p>
        <p class="description"> He jolted awake, gasping. The smell of incense filled his room though no sticks burned.
          On his table lay a book he hadn’t touched in days—Meera’s copy of <i>Devdas</i>. </p>
        <p class="description"> The next morning, when he confronted her, Meera’s eyes glistened with both love and
          fear. “The haveli… it belonged to my family,” she confessed. Her voice was barely a breath. “The woman you
          saw—she was my sister.” </p>
        <p class="description"> Arjun froze, the world tilting beneath him. The bruises, the silences, the villagers’
          warnings—all of it began to knit together into a truth too heavy to bear. </p>
        <p class="description"> Meera continued, her words trembling. “She died on her wedding night. Betrayed. They say
          she cursed the banyan before hanging herself from its roots. Since then, the haveli has not let anyone she
          loves go free.” </p>
        <p class="description"> The story settled like ash inside Arjun’s chest. He realized love here wasn’t just a
          tender bloom—it was a pact signed with fear. By loving Meera, he had already stepped into the curse’s embrace.
        </p>



        <!-- part 4 -->

        <h1>Part 4: The Truth </h1>

        <article class="story-content">
          <p class="description"> The days after Meera’s confession weighed heavily on Arjun. The school, the bazaar,
            even the children’s laughter—everything seemed quieter, as though the entire town held its breath. He
            noticed the way shopkeepers crossed themselves when the haveli came into view, the way women refused to step
            near the banyan even in daylight. </p>
          <p class="description"> Finally, one evening, Arjun pressed Meera for answers. They sat by the ghats where the
            river moved like liquid silver, reflecting a moon too pale to be comforting. The night smelled of wet clay
            and impending rain. </p>
          <p class="description"> Her silence stretched until he thought she wouldn’t speak. Then, slowly, her words
            came, heavy and deliberate, like stones being placed on his chest. </p>
          <p class="description"> Her sister’s name had been **Radha**. The town had adored her—bright, gentle, a beauty
            who carried kindness in her every gesture. On her wedding day, dressed in red silk and gold, she had looked
            like the goddess herself. But joy in Bhadrapur was fragile. Rumors whispered of the groom’s betrayal—another
            woman, another promise, a deception too cruel to surface on such a night. </p>
          <p class="description"> When Radha discovered the truth, she vanished before dawn. They found her at the
            banyan tree, the bridal veil torn, her body hanging from its roots like an unwilling offering. The villagers
            said her last cry had echoed through the haveli, shaking its walls. Since then, every generation of Meera’s
            family carried the weight of her curse. </p>
          <p class="description"> Meera’s voice broke as she spoke. “She loved deeply, but she died with betrayal in her
            heart. And that kind of pain doesn’t rest. It stays. It clings. It hunts.” </p>
          <p class="description"> Arjun reached for her hand. Her fingers were cold, unsteady, as though the very act of
            remembering drained her. “You’ve been living with this alone?” he asked, but his voice felt small against
            the enormity of her grief. </p>
          <p class="description"> The wind stirred suddenly, tossing dust into their eyes. The river’s surface rippled
            though no boat passed. For a heartbeat, Arjun thought he saw her—Radha’s reflection in the water, the torn
            bridal veil drifting on its surface. When he blinked, it was gone. </p>
          <p > That night, he dreamt again. The haveli’s corridors stretched endlessly, filled with
            whispers. This time Radha’s face was clear. Her eyes were not angry—they were hollow, infinite wells of
            grief. She held out her hand, blood dripping down her bangles, and spoke in a voice that was both thunder
            and sobbing rain. </p>
          <blockquote class="highlight-quote"> “If you love her… you must pay.” </blockquote>
          <p class="description"> Arjun woke with a cry, sweat soaking his shirt. Outside, the banyan swayed violently
            in a wind that did not touch any other tree. </p>
          <p class="description"> The following morning, he made a decision. Fear or no fear, curse or no curse, he
            couldn’t let Meera face this alone. He went to the temple priest, the only man in Bhadrapur who dared speak
            openly of the haveli. </p>
          <p class="description"> The priest was old, his skin like parchment, his eyes cloudy but sharp with knowing.
            He listened in silence, then nodded slowly. </p>
          <p class="description"> “The spirit is bound not by death, but by pain,” he explained. “As long as Radha’s
            betrayal is unhealed, she will wander. She will reach for those who still dare to love in her shadow. If you
            want to save Meera, you must face the spirit directly. Only love that refuses to break can undo the curse.”
          </p>
          <p class="description"> The words clung to Arjun’s chest like fire. He left the temple shaken but resolute.
            Love had brought him here against his will, but now it was his choice, his fight. </p>
          <p class="description"> That evening, he told Meera. She tried to stop him, her eyes fierce with terror. But
            beneath her fear, he sensed her longing—for someone to finally stand beside her against the curse that had
            haunted her family for generations. </p>
          <p class="description"> And so, hand in hand, they walked towards the banyan tree under a rising storm. The
            haveli loomed ahead, its broken windows glowing faintly as though lit from within by unseen flames. Shadows
            curled along its walls, waiting. Watching. </p>
          <p class="description"> The truth was no longer just a story. It was here, breathing with them, ready to claim
            its price. </p>
        </article>



        <!-- part 5 -->

        <h1>Part 5: The Sacrifice </h1>

        <article class="story-content">
          <p class="description"> The storm thickened as Arjun and Meera approached the banyan tree. Thunder cracked
            like splitting bones, and the roots writhed in the ground, slick with rain. The haveli’s windows glowed
            faint red, as if lit from inside by a pyre that never died. </p>
          <p class="description"> Arjun tightened his grip on Meera’s hand. She was trembling, her face pale, but she
            did not turn back. Together they stepped into the shadow of the tree, where the air was heavy with incense
            and decay. </p>
          <p class="description"> A sudden gust extinguished their lantern. Darkness swallowed them. Then came the
            whisper—soft at first, then rising into a wail that bent the branches above. </p>
          <blockquote class="highlight-quote"> “Why should you find love… when mine was stolen?” </blockquote>
          <p class="description"> From the haveli doorway emerged the figure Arjun had seen in his dreams. Radha. Draped
            in her bloodstained bridal sari, her veil hung like wet ash, her bangles dripping crimson into the soil. Her
            face was hauntingly beautiful, but hollowed with sorrow. </p>
          <p class="description"> Meera clung to Arjun, tears blurring her eyes. “Didi…” she whispered, her voice
            breaking. “Please, let us go.” </p>
          <p class="description"> Radha’s gaze shifted between them, burning with grief. The ground quaked. Roots rose,
            twisting around Arjun’s ankles, pulling him toward the tree. Pain shot through his legs, but he refused to
            let go of Meera’s hand. </p>
          <blockquote class="highlight-quote"> “Take me,” Arjun cried, his voice ragged against the wind. “If a price
            must be paid, let it be mine. But spare her. Spare Meera.” </blockquote>
          <p class="description"> The spirit paused, her hollow eyes locked on him. For the first time, sorrow flickered
            into something else—recognition. In Arjun’s defiance, in his willingness to break for love, she saw what she
            had been denied. </p>
          <p class="description"> The storm raged louder. Meera screamed, trying to pull him free, but the roots climbed
            higher, up to his chest, crushing his ribs. He gasped, vision darkening. Still, he clung to her hand,
            refusing to let go. </p>
          <p class="description"> Radha’s wail tore through the night, shaking the haveli’s crumbling walls. Then,
            slowly, she raised her hand, as though blessing a bridegroom. The roots shuddered and released Arjun. He
            collapsed into Meera’s arms, coughing, half-conscious. </p>
          <p class="description"> The spirit’s voice softened into a broken melody. “Love… that does not betray. Love…
            that endures.” Her form flickered, dissolving into the storm. For a heartbeat, she looked not like a ghost,
            but like a sister watching over Meera one last time. Then she vanished into the banyan roots. </p>
          <p class="description"> The storm calmed. The haveli’s glow dimmed to nothing. Only the rain remained, washing
            the earth clean. Arjun and Meera held each other, shaking, their breaths ragged. For the first time, the
            banyan was silent. </p>
          <p class="description"> Days later, villagers whispered that the curse was broken. Offerings still lay at the
            tree, but not from fear—out of respect. Meera’s laughter returned, no longer brittle but free. Arjun knew
            the scars of that night would never leave him, yet he carried them with pride. They were proof of a love
            strong enough to face shadows. </p>
          <p class="description"> On their last evening in Bhadrapur, Arjun and Meera stood together beneath the banyan,
            a single lamp flickering between them. </p>
          <blockquote class="highlight-quote"> “We’ll write our own story now,” he whispered. “One that no curse can
            erase.” </blockquote>
          <p class="description"> Meera leaned against him, her eyes shining. The roots lay still, the haveli silent, as
            though even the shadows had finally given them their blessing. </p>
          <p class="description"> Love had not erased the darkness. But it had endured it, and in enduring, had set them
            free. </p>
        </article>


        <!-- part final -->

        <h1>Final Chapter: Epilogue</h1>

        <article class="story-content">
          <p class="description"> Months passed. The project that had once felt like exile now felt like destiny
            fulfilled. Arjun returned to Delhi, but Bhadrapur did not leave him. The banyan, the haveli, the storm —
            they were etched into his memory, a scar that pulsed whenever silence grew too deep. </p>
          <p class="description"> Meera joined him later, carrying her books, her dreams, and her smile that had
            survived shadows. Together they built a small life — ordinary yet extraordinary in the way it stood against
            everything the curse had once threatened. </p>
          <p class="description"> Sometimes, late at night, Arjun would wake and think he heard anklets in the hallway,
            or the rustle of silk. The scent of incense would drift through their apartment without warning. He never
            told Meera. He would simply pull her closer, as if to remind both of them that Radha’s shadow had not
            returned for vengeance, but for memory. </p>
          <p class="description"> One monsoon evening, they visited Bhadrapur again. The town looked different —
            children played near the banyan without fear, and the haveli, though still abandoned, no longer glared with
            menace. The windows were just windows, broken but harmless. The roots lay heavy but calm, as though the tree
            itself had finally exhaled. </p>
          <p class="description"> Meera placed a small diya at the foot of the tree, her hands steady this time. Arjun
            watched her, his heart quiet, his fear dissolved into reverence. For a moment, the flame flickered against
            the wet bark, casting shadows that almost resembled a woman’s face. A sister’s face. </p>
          <blockquote class="highlight-quote"> “Thank you,” Meera whispered to the roots. “For letting us go.”
          </blockquote>
          <p class="description"> The diya burned steadily despite the drizzle, its glow tender and defiant. Arjun
            slipped his hand into hers, and together they turned away, walking toward a future that belonged to them
            alone. </p>
          <p class="description"> Behind them, the banyan stood silent, no longer cursed, but not forgotten. Some
            stories do not vanish; they transform. The spirit of Radha lingered not as a curse now, but as a reminder —
            that love, when it refuses to betray, can bend even the darkest fate. </p>
          <p class="description"> And in the hush of the rain, if one listened closely, it almost felt as though the
            banyan itself sighed, content at last. </p>

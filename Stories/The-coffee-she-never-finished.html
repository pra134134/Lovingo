It was a rainy afternoon in Bangalore, the kind of afternoon when the sky looked like it had swallowed all the colors of the city, leaving only shades of grey. People hurried across M.G. Road, umbrellas flipping under the weight of the wind, raindrops racing down glass windows. The world outside seemed restless, but inside the small café “Mocha Tales,” time was slower, calmer, and smelled faintly of roasted coffee beans and warm croissants.
</p>

<p class="description">
Rhea sat near the window, her chin resting on her palm, eyes following the trail of raindrops. She had ordered a cappuccino almost twenty minutes ago, but she hadn’t touched it. The steam had long disappeared, leaving the cup abandoned, like a promise broken halfway. She scribbled something in her notebook—tiny words, half sentences, doodles of clouds and raindrops. 
</p>

<p class="description">
She wasn’t waiting for anyone. Or maybe, she was. She wasn’t sure herself. All she knew was that she kept coming to this café every Friday after work, taking the same seat by the window, ordering the same coffee, and leaving it unfinished. 
</p>

<p class="description">
What no one knew was that this ritual wasn’t really hers—it belonged to someone else. Someone she had lost. Someone whose absence tasted stronger than the coffee she never finished.
</p>

"Sometimes, it’s not the presence we keep alive, but the absence we feed every single day."

<p class="description">
On the other side of the café, Arjun entered hurriedly, shaking raindrops off his jacket. He was late for a client meeting, but Bangalore traffic had a way of teaching patience even to the most impatient souls. He scanned the café for a quiet corner where he could open his laptop and prepare, but the place was unusually crowded. The only vacant spot was across from a girl by the window, who seemed lost in her own world.
</p>

<p class="description">
He hesitated for a moment before walking over. “Excuse me, is this seat taken?” he asked, pointing at the chair opposite her. 
</p>

<p class="description">
Rhea looked up, a little startled, as though pulled back from a world only she could see. She shook her head lightly. “No, go ahead.”
</p>

<p class="description">
Arjun sat, setting his laptop bag down. He quickly opened his device, eyes glued to the screen, fingers flying over the keyboard. Rhea went back to staring out the window, pretending not to notice him. But she couldn’t help stealing glances. He was sharp, maybe in his late twenties, dressed in a formal shirt, his hair slightly messy from the rain. There was something focused about him, something that made him look like he was running a race only he knew about.
</p>

<p class="description">
Minutes passed in silence, except for the sound of typing and the rain tapping against the glass. Then, without realizing, Arjun glanced at the untouched cup in front of her. “Cold coffee doesn’t taste good, you know,” he said casually, not lifting his eyes from the screen.
</p>

<p class="description">
Rhea blinked, surprised. “What?”
</p>

<p class="description">
He nodded toward her cup. “You’ve been staring out of the window for the past half an hour. That cappuccino hasn’t moved an inch.”
</p>

<p class="description">
She let out a dry laugh, shaking her head. “Maybe I like watching it go cold.”
</p>

<p class="description">
Arjun finally looked up, curiosity flashing in his eyes. “That’s… unusual. Most people order coffee to drink it.”
</p>

<p class="description">
“Most people,” she repeated softly, almost to herself. Then, as if realizing she had said too much, she changed the subject. “You seem busy. Work?”
</p>

<p class="description">
“Yeah,” he said, leaning back slightly. “Advertising. Deadlines chase us like shadows.”
</p>

<p class="description">
Rhea smiled faintly, but it didn’t reach her eyes. She closed her notebook, tucked it into her bag, and finally picked up the cup. For a second, Arjun thought she might actually drink it. But instead, she just held it between her palms, feeling the cold porcelain against her skin.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
"Some cups are meant to be held, not finished."
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
Arjun tilted his head, studying her. He wasn’t usually the kind to notice strangers, but something about her unsettled him. She looked like someone who carried stories she wasn’t ready to tell, like the coffee in front of her—left unfinished for a reason.
</p>

<p class="description">
Before he could ask more, his phone buzzed with a reminder. His client had arrived. He packed up quickly, gave her a polite nod, and left. But the image of the girl by the window, with the coffee she never finished, lingered in his mind long after he walked into the meeting.
</p>

<p class="description">
Rhea, too, watched him leave. She didn’t know why she cared, but for the first time in months, someone had noticed her unfinished coffee. And that, strangely, felt like the beginning of something she couldn’t name yet.

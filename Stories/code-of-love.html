      <p>
  Once upon a time, in a world where algorithms shaped destinies, two hearts found each other through lines of code. Their story was written not in ink, but in the language of love and logic, proving that even in a digital age, true connection is timeless.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Rishi Verma lived life behind screens—quiet, brilliant, and always one step ahead in the tech world. But beneath the layers of code and logic, he often wondered if something real could exist beyond the virtual.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  One day, he stumbled upon Tanya Sharma’s profile—@tanya.unfiltered. Her smile was chaotic, her captions poetic, and her stories a beautiful mess of emotions. She wasn’t just another influencer—she was a spark of truth.
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  They met at a tech seminar in Pune. Tanya was live-streaming the event, while Rishi was the keynote speaker. His words were precise, but his eyes kept drifting toward the girl in the front row who mouthed “too serious” and winked.
</p>

<p class="description">
  After the session, she walked up to him and said, “You speak like a machine, but your eyes glitch when you feel something.” That was the beginning of a story neither of them saw coming.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Their bond grew over midnight calls, chai dates, and shared playlists. Tanya posted everything—from their first fight to their first kiss. Rishi never posted a thing. Her followers called him “The Silent One.”
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  “Why don’t you ever post about me?” Tanya asked one evening, curled up in his hoodie.  
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  Rishi replied softly, “Because I don’t want the world to know what I’m scared to lose.” She smiled, and for once, didn’t post that moment. It was theirs alone.
</p>

<p class="description">
  But love, like code, sometimes crashes. One morning, Tanya vanished. No texts. No calls. Her account went silent. Rishi spiraled, refreshing her profile every hour, hoping for a sign.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Weeks passed. Then months. Until one day, a notification popped up: “@tanya.unfiltered posted after 6 months.” His heart raced. He clicked.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  It was a photo of an empty beach. Just footprints fading into the waves. Caption: “Some stories are meant to be deleted. But I kept yours in drafts.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  Rishi stared at the screen. He knew what it meant. She was saying goodbye—not with words, but with silence. A digital farewell.
</p>

<p class="description">
  That night, Rishi opened his own Instagram for the first time. He posted a photo of her laughing, wind in her hair, eyes closed.
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  Caption: “I loved you in silence. You left me in noise.”
</blockquote>

<p class="description">
  It got three likes. One was from @tanya.unfiltered. Then her account disappeared. Deleted. Gone.
</p>

<p class="description">
  Rishi never posted again. But every night, he opened his drafts and read the story he never published:
</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-quote">
  “Offline Forever. But never out of memory.”
</blockquote>
